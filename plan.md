# Product Enrichment App — standalone, off-Xano

## Context

Tillin's multi-brand fashion retailers need to enrich batches of products (description, meta description, images, title, variant weights) by pulling official content from each **brand's own e-commerce site** (mostly Shopify), generating copy with an LLM, and processing images (background recolor + resize to **4:5** + format). Today a similar pipeline runs *inside Xano* one product at a time — but Xano already has performance issues, so we are **building a separate standalone app on its own infrastructure**. Xano keeps its existing role as catalog master and is touched only for **cheap final writes** (approved results), which then sync to Shopify via Tillin's existing integration.

This is a **new project, separate from the Xano repo** (new Git repository, e.g. `tillin-enrichment-app`). Only a few small XanoScript additions are needed for writeback glue (delegated to the Xano agents); the bulk is a normal web app.

### Locked decisions
- **Stack:** SvelteKit frontend + **FastAPI (Python)** backend + background worker + **Postgres**.
- **Hosting:** Managed PaaS — **Railway or Render** (web service + worker service + Postgres in one place).
- **Database:** Postgres on the same PaaS (app's own state; nothing extra on Xano).
- **Scraping:** **Shopify JSON first → Firecrawl fallback**, with a **manual method override per run and per product** (some Shopify pages hold data outside the JSON; sometimes go straight to Firecrawl). Pluggable fetcher so a heavy anti-bot backend can be added.
- **Anti-bot backend:** **Bright Data Web Unlocker** (chosen over Zyte) for WAF-protected sites like Farfetch / Asics — **deferred to a later phase/task**. Start with Shopify JSON + Firecrawl; the fetcher interface is built from day one so Web Unlocker plugs in without rework.
- **Images:** two pipelines — deterministic via **Photoroom API** (bg removal + bg color + pad to **4:5** + format/quality in one call) and generative via **FASHN API** (`product-to-model`: packshot → worn by model). Fully specced in the dedicated **« Sprint imagerie — Image Processing Service »** section below (business verbs + adapters, Xano as final storage, wrapper-level metering).
  - **Product-panel image tools (user-requested 2026-07-09, NOT built yet):** the product side panel (see IA section) reserves a disabled "Images (Photoroom)" section. Planned actions, per image: détourage (cutout), reformatage/redimensionnement (ratio/size presets), and generative: produit porté par un mannequin à partir d'un packshot à plat (FASHN), et l'inverse (à plat depuis une photo portée — deferred, no confirmed FASHN endpoint). Every Photoroom/FASHN call will be metered through `usage_event` like Claude calls (wrapper-level). → Phase A of the imagery sprint.
- **Copy:** **Claude** default (`claude-sonnet-4-6`), provider switch to OpenAI; configurable per job/brand.
- **Transforms (all):** description+meta, images (bg+recolor+resize 4:5), **title by template**, **image filename by template**, **variant weights on existing products**.
- **Write mode:** stage → **review queue** → approve → apply to Tillin (Xano) → Tillin syncs to Shopify.
- **Selection:** a list of product IDs **or** a tag.
- **Async, fire-and-forget:** you launch a job and **leave** — processing runs server-side on the worker, independent of the browser. You come back later (the job survives a closed tab / logout) and review staged results when they're ready. Optional **notification when the job finishes** (email/in-app).

> Per saved feedback for the Xano side: never auto-push (user does Ctrl+S + manual push), `enforce_hidden_fields = true` on every `db.add`/`db.edit`.

## Architecture

```
SvelteKit app (Railway/Render)        FastAPI backend + worker (Railway/Render)         External / Xano
──────────────────────────────        ─────────────────────────────────────────        ─────────────────
/jobs/new  select IDs|tag  ─POST─▶  POST /jobs  → create job + enqueue items (app Postgres)
/jobs/[id] progress        ◀GET───  worker loop (concurrency + rate limit + retry):
/jobs/[id]/review                     1. resolve_source_url(product, method)  ───────▶  Shopify .json / suggest.json
  before/after, approve    ─POST─▶                                                        Firecrawl (fallback / full page)
                                      2. generate_copy(provider, model)        ───────▶  Claude / OpenAI
                                      3. normalize_product_image(bg, 4:5, fmt)  ───────▶  Photoroom  → local staging → Xano (bulk)
                                      4. apply_title_template / map_weights
                                      5. stage result on enrichment_item (ready_for_review)
  approve item            ─POST─▶  POST /items/{id}/approve  ──────────────────────────▶  Xano: write desc/meta/title/
                                                                                           weights/images (cheap)
                                                                                           → Tillin syncs to Shopify
```

All API keys (Firecrawl, Photoroom, Anthropic/OpenAI, Xano token, Bright Data) live **server-side in FastAPI**. The browser only talks to the backend.

### Async lifecycle (core requirement)
The pipeline is **fully asynchronous** — you do not wait on it:
1. `POST /jobs` returns **immediately** with a `job_id` after enqueuing items (status `pending`). The UI navigates to a job page; you can close the tab.
2. A **separate worker service** drains the queue on its own schedule (concurrency cap + per-host rate limit + retry). It keeps running whether or not anyone is connected.
3. Each finished item flips to `ready_for_review` with its staged result persisted in Postgres. The job moves `pending → processing → completed/partial`.
4. You return **any time later**, open `/jobs/[id]/review`, and approve/edit/reject staged results. Approval is itself fast and independent per item.
5. Optional **"notify when done"** (email or in-app badge) so you don't have to poll manually.

Because state lives in the app's Postgres (not the browser, not Xano), jobs are durable across logouts, restarts, and deploys, and can be resumed.

## Backend (FastAPI) — modules

- **`xano_client.py`** — Tillin REST API wrapper (service token).
  - Read: products by tag or ID list with fields the pipeline needs (title, brand + `brand.website_url`, `product_reference_code`, variants[sku, barcode, weight, weight_unit], images, season, category, department). Reuse existing `products_with_pagination*` endpoints where possible.
  - Write (approve): description+meta via existing `apis/.../3176_product_product_id_enrich_POST.xs`; **title** + **variant weights** via thin new endpoints (see Xano section); images via attach-from-URL endpoint.
- **`sources/`** — pluggable fetchers behind one interface `fetch_source(url|reference, method)`:
  - `shopify_json.py` — `/products/{handle}.json`; `/search/suggest.json` matcher + scoring **ported from** `functions/ai_process_image_feature/1079_import_single_shopify_product.xs` (SKU exact/contains, title, handle, tags).
  - `firecrawl.py` — scrape + `/extract` (LLM-structured) for full product pages / non-Shopify / data outside the JSON.
  - `unlocker.py` — **Bright Data Web Unlocker** (added in Phase 3, deferred task; interface ready now).
  - `resolver.py` — `resolve_source_url(product, website_urls[], method=auto|shopify_json|firecrawl|unlocker)` → `{url, score, method_used, candidates}` or skip-with-reason.

#### Product matching — how a Tillin product is found on the brand site (core)
Chain: **brand → site(s) → search → fetch candidates → score → confidence gate → human fallback.**
1. **Source site(s):** `product.brand_id` → `brand.website_urls` (one **or more** — a brand may sell across several stores/domains), **plus** any extra URLs the user supplies at the job level or per product. The resolver searches **all** provided URLs and aggregates candidates. No URL anywhere → skip with reason (or user pastes one in review).
2. **Search by identifier (in priority order):** query each site with `GET {site}/search/suggest.json?q={barcode}` then `{reference}` then `{title}` (`&resources[type]=product&resources[options][fields]=variants.sku`); HTML `/search?q=` fallback; Firecrawl search-page extraction for non-Shopify. **Do not use Tillin's SKU** — it is Tillin-generated and will not match the brand's SKU.
3. **Fetch candidates:** `{site}/products/{handle}.json` for each candidate across all sites.
4. **Score each candidate** and keep the global best above a confidence threshold. Identifier priority:
   1. **Variant barcode / EAN / UPC exact** — manufacturer code shared across catalogs; most reliable primary key.
   2. **Tillin `product_reference_code`** — match against the brand's variant SKU / handle / title / tags (exact → contains).
   3. **Product title + color** — fuzzy similarity tie-breaker.
   - Tillin SKU is **excluded**. This replaces the existing `1079` scorer's SKU-first logic (which assumed matching SKUs) and **adds barcode + reference + title/color** — the biggest reliability win for a multi-brand catalog.
5. **Confidence gate:** strong match (esp. barcode) → auto-stage; ambiguous/low → `needs_manual`, with top candidates from all sites surfaced in the review queue for the user to pick or paste the correct URL; early-exit on near-perfect match.

Port the `suggest.json` + `scoreProductMatch` logic from `functions/ai_process_image_feature/1079_import_single_shopify_product.xs` to Python, **re-rank to barcode → reference → title+color (drop Tillin SKU)**, and search across multiple URLs. Requires reading each variant's `barcode` + the product's `product_reference_code` from Xano (already in scope).
- **`enrich/`** — pipeline steps:
  - `copy.py` — `generate_copy(provider, model, product_ctx, editorial_instructions, translate)` → `{description_fr, meta_description_fr}` (Anthropic SDK / OpenAI SDK). Verify request shape via the `claude-api` skill.
  - `images.py` — **superseded by the « Sprint imagerie — Image Processing Service » section below** (business verbs in `backend/app/imaging/`, no third-party object storage — Xano is the durable store). Historical spec kept for the details reused by the sprint (off-center QA, formats, per-category sizing): `process_image(src, bg_color, ratio="4:5", long_edge, fmt, quality, padding, alignment, center_offset?)` via Photoroom. Filename from `filename_template` (`{reference}_{color}_{position}`).
    - **Auto-centering (default):** Photoroom cuts out the subject and **centers it by default**; we set `outputSize` to the 4:5 target (e.g. `1600x2000`), `padding` (~`"10%"`), `backgroundColor`, and `horizontalAlignment` → consistent centered product shots with uniform margins across the catalog.
    - **Off-center detection (QA flag):** from the returned cutout's alpha, `Pillow.getbbox()` → compare subject-bbox center to frame center; if offset > threshold, badge the item `off_center` in the review queue.
    - **Manual recenter (exceptions):** request the **transparent cutout** from Photoroom and **composite in Python (Pillow)** at a user-supplied `center_offset` on the 4:5 canvas → pixel-perfect, deterministic. Triggered from the review UI when auto-centering isn't right.
    - **Output format/weight:** format preference **WebP > JPEG > PNG (no AVIF)**. Store a **WebP master** (q≈80) at 1600×2000, **capped ~200 KB** (step quality down to hit `max_kb`); JPEG fallback; PNG only if transparency is ever needed. Note: Shopify's CDN re-encodes (WebP) + resizes on the fly, so the stored format mainly matters for Tillin's own (POS/Bubble) display.
    - **Per-category consistent sizing (deferred enhancement):** optional per-category **fill ratio** (target % of frame the subject occupies, via Photoroom `padding`/`outputSize`), keyed off the product's category, so products within a category share scale/proportion. Feasible and low-cost but adds a per-category config + tuning UI → **not Phase 1**.
  - `title.py` — `apply_title_template(product, template)` tokens `{brand}{title}{season}{reference}{color}{category}{department}`.
  - `weights.py` — match Tillin variants to source variants by SKU then barcode; convert weight (kg/g/lb/oz) — port `toKg` from `1079`.
- **`jobs/`** — `enrichment_job` + `enrichment_item` tables (app Postgres) and the worker.
  - Worker: **DB-backed queue** (poll `enrichment_item` where `status=pending`), async concurrency cap, **per-host rate limiting**, retry with backoff (`tenacity`), `attempt_count` max 3 → `failed`. Runs as a separate PaaS worker service. (Upgrade path: ARQ+Redis if volume grows — Railway/Render add Redis trivially.)
- **`api/`** — routes: `POST /jobs`, `GET /jobs`, `GET /jobs/{id}`, `GET /items/{id}`, `PATCH /items/{id}` (edit staged), `POST /items/{id}/approve`, `POST /items/{id}/reject`, `POST /jobs/{id}/apply_approved`, `GET /products` (proxy to Xano for selection), `GET/PUT /brands` (manage `website_url`). Auth: simple app login (or proxy Xano user auth).

### App data model (Postgres)
- `enrichment_job(id, status, selection_json, config_json, counts, created_at)`.
- `enrichment_item(id, job_id, tillin_product_id, status, source_url, source_method, match_score, staged_title, staged_description, staged_meta, staged_images_json[urls], staged_weights_json, error, attempt_count, timestamps)`.
- `config_json`: transforms toggles; `title_template`; `filename_template`; image `{bg_color, ratio:"4:5", long_edge:2000, format:"webp" (fallback "jpeg"), quality:80, max_kb:200, padding, alignment, pad_strategy:"contain_pad"}`; ai `{provider, model, editorial_instructions, translate}`; scrape `{default_method, per_product_overrides}`; source `{extra_website_urls[], per_product_url_override}` (user-supplied search sites in addition to `brand.website_urls`).

---

## Frontend (SvelteKit) — routes
- `/login`
- `/jobs/new` — select products (paste IDs or pick a tag via `/products`), config form (transform toggles, title template, filename template, bg color, resize 4:5 target, AI provider/model, editorial instructions, translate, **default scrape method**, **extra search URLs** to add to the brands' own `website_urls`), launch.
- `/jobs/[id]` — progress (poll job status + counts).
- `/jobs/[id]/review` — per item: **before/after** for description, meta, title; original vs Photoroom image thumbnails; proposed weights; source URL + match score + **method used**, with a **"re-run with method X"** control (shopify_json / firecrawl / unlocker); approve / edit / reject; **Apply approved**. Per image: `off_center` badge when flagged, alignment + padding nudge, and a **"set center" pinpoint** that re-composites the cutout (Pillow) at the clicked anchor.
- `/settings/brands` — set/edit one or more `brand.website_urls` per brand (writes to Xano).

Talks only to FastAPI. Lightweight; no heavy client deps.

---

## Xano-side additions (minimal — delegated to Xano agents)
Cheap glue only; no pipeline compute on Xano:
- **`brand.website_urls`** (text **array**, Table Designer) — one *or more* source sites per brand (a brand may sell across several stores/domains) + expose in brand GET/`295_brand_POST`. The app searches all of them, plus any extra URLs the user supplies per job or per product.
- ~~Thin `POST product/{id}/attach_images_from_urls`~~ — **OBSOLETE 2026-07-10**: superseded by **`POST /product_image/{product_id}/bulk`** (accepts `text[] image_urls` AND `file[] files` — files branch shipped & validated end-to-end via `XanoClient.upload_product_images`; response returns the created image `id`s) + **`PUT /product_image/deactivate`** (`product_image_ids: int[]`, created by Marc 2026-07-10) for replacement, since the bulk only APPENDS. No object storage needed — bytes go straight to Xano. (`.xs` export of the deactivate endpoint still to drop into `fichiers_xano/endpoints_xano/`.)
- ~~Thin `POST product/{id}/set_variant_weights`~~ — **SHIPPED 2026-07-09** via Tillin's **`PUT /product/weight`** (body `{product_ids:[…], weight_unit:"1", weight:N}`; unit codes 1=kg/2=g/3=lb/4=oz). Note: it is **product-level** (one weight per batch of products, PUT not POST), so the destination adapter reduces the reviewer-selected per-variant proposals to a single value — boutique convention: variants share one weight → take the first selected. Client `set_product_weight`, wired in `xano_tillin.apply`. Validated live (writes to all variants of the product).
- Confirm the product update path accepts **title**; if not, add a thin title-update endpoint. Reuse `3176 enrich` for description+meta.
- Provision a **Xano API token / service user** for the app.

---

## Phasing
- **Phase 0 — skeleton:** repo + SvelteKit + FastAPI deployed on Railway/Render with Postgres; `xano_client` reads products by tag; login. Proves the read path.
- **Phase 1 — pipeline correctness (run on one product):** Shopify JSON match by reference → Claude copy → Photoroom 4:5 image → title template → weight mapping → stage → review UI → approve → write back to Xano (desc/meta/title/weights/images). Validates every transform on a single product before scaling.
- **Phase 2 — async batch (the real UX):** job/item queue + separate **worker service** so you launch a job, leave, and come back to review. Concurrency + rate limit + retry, progress page, apply-approved, optional notify-when-done.
- **Phase 3 — robust scraping — Firecrawl part SHIPPED 2026-07-10:** Firecrawl v2 fallback wired end-to-end: `FirecrawlClient.search` (POST /v2/search, 2 credits) + `extract_product` (POST /v2/scrape `formats:[{type:"json",schema}]` → `data.json`, 5 credits) ; resolver `method=auto` chains Shopify → Firecrawl (max 2 sites, reference then title queries — barcodes excluded from web search —, max 2 extracts/run; page carrying the product reference → `resolved` 0.9 `method_used=firecrawl`, else clean `needs_manual` with the found pages as candidates), `method=firecrawl|shopify_json` = per-job override via `config_json.scrape.default_method`; `stage_from_url` accepts ANY url (Shopify first, else Firecrawl extraction, score 0.9/0.5) — this is the salomon.com repair path (their main site is NOT Shopify; suggest.json 404 even following redirects). Shared brand-site client now follows redirects. Metering: `usage_event` provider `firecrawl` metric `credits` (search 2 / extract 5) with job/item ids. Source images deduped before Photoroom (LLM extraction can repeat URLs — seen live). Live-validated on salomon.com: auto fallback surfaces the right product pages as candidates (test product has no title/barcode, reference not indexed → needs_manual by design), manual URL restage extracts + normalizes 6 CDN images. Still open: **Bright Data Web Unlocker** for WAF sites (Farfetch/Asics) via the ready-made `unlocker.py` interface; frontend method-override control in review (« re-run with method X ») — the manual URL input already covers the practical need.
- **Phase 4 — polish:** brand `website_urls` settings UI, optional direct Shopify push, run history + per-provider cost tracking.
- **Steerable generation sprint ("Sprint B") — SHIPPED 2026-07-08:** move the account "Enrichissement" defaults out of the Paramètres page into their **own settings tab/section**, built around an **instruction library**: as many named editorial instructions/prompts as the user wants (CRUD + per-category defaults), selectable at job creation (or free-text one-off), instead of the single `editorial_instructions` default shipped 2026-07-08. Same tab hosts the per-client context (.md rules per boutique, à la L'Espion/Bambinoh), per-item extra source URLs + SEO keywords, and the title-template builder (clickable tokens + separator — the builder itself shipped early on the Paramètres page and moves here with the rest). Delivered: `instruction_template` table + /instructions CRUD, job-creation snapshot (`instruction_id` → editorial_instructions, per-category defaults via `category_instructions`), `client_context` account setting prefixed to the copy prompt, `seo_keywords` + `extra_website_urls` job config keys, parameterized `meta_max_length` (review counter reads it too), Paramètres tabs (Préférences / Enrichissement / Compte) with the instruction library UI and a shared JobOptionsPanel at job creation. Still open from this scope: per-ITEM source URLs/keywords overrides in review (job-level shipped; per-item manual URL resolution already existed) and the image dedupe guard to make `applied` items retryable.
- **Import sprint (parallel track):** supplier file (PDF/Excel/CSV) → analyze → create products in Tillin — see the dedicated section below; can run alongside Phases 2–4 once the platform pieces (jobs/review/writeback) exist.
- **Information architecture — SHIPPED 2026-07-09 (user-validated decisions):** the sidebar now tells the pipeline story: section **Pipeline** (Tableau de bord, Imports, Produits, Enrichissements — ex-« Jobs ») and section **Configuration** (Profils d'import, Instructions — ex-« Enrichissement », Consommation), Paramètres at the bottom; URLs unchanged. Harmonized status wording everywhere: « À vérifier » (ready_for_review), « Écarter/Écarté » (rejected — replaces both « Rejeter » and « Exclure »), final state stays contextual (« Transféré » for imports = creation, « Appliqué » for enrichments = update). Products page has two tabs: **Catalogue** (Tillin search + filters) and **Par import** (an import's products, isolated — resolved to Tillin by reference_code via POST /imports/{id}/link-products since /product_import returns no ids; stored on import_item.tillin_product_id, migration 0014). Product **side panel** (ProductPanel) on row click in both tabs: two completeness scores — « Prêt boutique » (titre, réf, ≥1 variante, prix, catégorie, marque) and « Prêt e-commerce » (≥1 image, description, meta, poids) + non-blocking « titre harmonisé » indicator — plus images gallery and « Enrichir ce produit ». Bridge from a transferred import: « Voir les produits créés » / « Enrichir les produits créés ». Dashboard gained « Imports à vérifier ». Orphan /jobs/new removed.
- **Product panel expansion + read-mapping fixes — SHIPPED 2026-07-09:** the side panel got wider (`sm:w-[36rem]`), completeness moved to the **bottom**, and now shows description, meta description, a **variants table** (taille, couleur, EAN, SKU, prix d'achat, prix de vente), composition, tags, pays de fabrication, plus **local image upload + camera capture with real persistence** (« Enregistrer » posts the raw bytes to `POST /products/{id}/images` → proxied as repeated-`files` multipart to Tillin's `product_image/{id}/bulk`, which imports each into **Xano storage** and appends a `product_image` row; the Xano token never reaches the browser). No intermediate object storage: Xano is both host and destination. Validated end-to-end through the CatalogAI UI. The same bulk endpoint keeps its URL branch for already-hosted images (scraping/Photoroom output). Root-cause fix behind « saison/rayon vides »: `_map_product` (xano.py) never read `season_id`/`department_id`/`composition_id`/`tags_id`/`manufacturing_country` — now resolved via the classification maps (season/composition/tags) and a **static department map** `{1: Homme, 2: Femme, 3: Unisex}` (Tillin exposes no department titles: no `/department` endpoint, absent from get_all_informations). Variant **couleur/taille** are read from the positional `options` array aligned to `product_options` (`{name, position}`); variant **prix d'achat** from `wholesale_price.amount`. `Product`/`ProductVariant` schema + generated client extended accordingly. Verified live on real products (season « FW24 », rayon « Homme », real tags, split color/size, achat/vente).
- **Import extraction → category tree matching — SHIPPED 2026-07-09:** the extractor now receives the boutique's own category tree (« parent > enfant » paths built from get_all_informations, best-effort via `_known_category_paths` in import_runner) and maps each product's supplier category onto an **existing** category (prompt instruction + deterministic leaf canonicalization to the tree's casing, confidence 1.0; unmatched labels kept verbatim for manual mapping). Extraction schema stays union-free (category remains a string). Previously extraction copied the raw supplier label with no tree awareness.
- **Current priority order (user decision 2026-07-09):** 1. Usage metering M2/M3 and Enrichment workspace — both SHIPPED (see below); 2. infra/prod items (Railway deploy, rate-limit retry, Brevo, Firecrawl/Bright Data) — NOT started (`set_variant_weights` DONE, see above); 3. LAST: import I3 direct Xano creation (the /product_import CSV transfer covers the need for now — keep the I3 checkpoints/reminders when it comes up).
- **Enrichment workspace sprint — SHIPPED 2026-07-09:** the account "Enrichissement" defaults moved out of Paramètres into their own sidebar workspace `/enrichment` (menu label "Instructions" since the IA pass below), 3 internal tabs — Instructions (library + search + account default), Contexte boutique (client_context markdown + meta_max_length), Modèle de titre (token builder + separator + **title casing** — see below). Settings keeps only true preferences (Préférences / Marques / Compte). Components moved to `lib/components/enrichment/`.
- **Title casing (user-requested 2026-07-09) — SHIPPED:** `AccountSettings.title_case` (none | upper | capitalize), snapshotted per job, applied in `apply_title_template`; `capitalize` upper-cases each word's first letter only, preserving acronyms/brand casing (e.g. "COTON", "ARMEDANGELS"). Builder in Modèle de titre has a case selector with live preview.

## Import sprint — supplier file → product creation in Tillin (dedicated sprint)

A second product line **upstream** of enrichment: instead of enriching products that already exist in Tillin, the user uploads a **supplier file** (order PDF, Excel, or CSV), the app analyzes it, and **creates** the products in Tillin. This automates the manual workflows already done for the **L'Espion** and **Bambinoh** boutiques (supplier PDF/Excel → Tillin import CSV), and chains naturally into enrichment afterwards (import creates the products; an enrichment job completes them).

It is a **dedicated sprint**, not Phase 5 of enrichment: it has its own pipeline (parse → normalize → stage), its own domain (per-boutique/supplier conventions), and only shares the platform (jobs/worker/review/writeback). It can be built **in parallel** with the remaining enrichment phases.

### Flow

```
/imports/new  upload file + pick boutique/supplier profile
   → POST /imports  (job type "import", file stored to object storage)
   → worker: 1. parse file        (pdf → text/tables via LLM; xlsx/csv → rows)
             2. extract products  (LLM-structured → normalized product schema)
             3. apply profile     (pricing rule, brand rule, category mapping, season…)
             4. stage import_item (ready_for_review, with per-field confidence)
   → /imports/[id]/review  edit/approve/reject per product (spreadsheet-like grid)
   → apply approved → destination port:
        a) MVP: generate the Tillin import CSV (download / hand to existing import)
        b) later: create directly via Xano API (products + variants + barcodes)
```

### Backend modules (reuses the existing skeleton)

- **`imports/`** — new package, sibling of `enrich/`:
  - `parsers/` — one parser per file family behind `parse_file(bytes, mime) -> RawDocument`:
    - `pdf.py` — supplier order PDFs. Extraction via **Claude with document/vision input** (PDFs are heterogeneous per supplier; deterministic table extraction is the fallback, LLM is the default).
      - **Cheaper-extraction alternatives (bonus, post-v1 — decided 2026-07-09):** v1 ships Claude doc/vision ONLY, with no extraction-strategy abstraction beyond the existing `parse_file(bytes, mime)` seam. After real usage, the metering brick's `GET /usage/by-job` gives actual per-file token costs; if they warrant it, cheaper paths slot in behind the same seam (text-layer extraction + a smaller model for born-digital PDFs, deterministic table extraction per recurring supplier format, Haiku for simple column-mapping on tabular files). Do NOT pre-build a strategy/plugin system for this.
    - `tabular.py` — Excel (`openpyxl`) + CSV; header detection and column mapping are LLM-assisted, values are read deterministically from the rows (prices/EANs must never be hallucinated).
  - `extract.py` — LLM-structured extraction to a **normalized product schema**: `{supplier_ref, ean/barcode, title, color, sizes[], qty, wholesale_price, retail_price?, category?, brand?}` with a per-field `confidence`. Numeric/EAN fields are cross-checked against the raw cells (no generated values).
    - **Schema decision (2026-07-09):** the internal schema is a **clean model informed by Tillin's product data design** (product / variant / barcode, as already mapped by `clients/xano.py`) — NOT the Tillin import CSV template. The template is a flat, lossy destination format; the internal schema must also carry review-only data (confidence, wholesale price, ordered qty, raw supplier ref). Two constraints lock it: it must render **losslessly to the Tillin import CSV** (I2 path) and map cleanly to the Xano product entities (I3 path). Freeze it in the main thread at sprint start by confronting the import template + the Xano product model + the real fixture files below.
    - **Tillin product data model (reference):** XanoScript table definitions live in `tables_xano/` (one file per table, prefixed by Xano table id). Semantics confirmed by Marc (2026-07-09):
      - Import CSV = one row per variant, product grouped by `reference_code`; **color is a product option** (option1 Couleur, option2 Taille) — the "new color, same reference" case adds variants + an option value to an existing product.
      - `weight_unit` enum: 1=kg, 2=g, 3=lb, 4=oz.
      - `product.title` is the main display field; at creation fill BOTH `title` and `title_label` with the same value.
      - CSV `gender` (Homme/Femme/Unisexe) is matched to the `department` table inside the Xano import workflow.
      - Category path `A > B > C` fills BOTH `category_id` (first category of the path) and `category_ids[]` (every category of the path).
      - Do NOT fill `supplier_product_reference_code`.
      - The CSV importer creates the `price` rows itself and fills the variant's denormalized decimals from `price`/`wholesale_price`/`tax_rate` — direct creation (I3) must replicate this (checkpoint discussion).
    - **Why not just the CSV template (trade-off, discussed 2026-07-09):** normalizing on the CSV would be simpler to wire (the existing Tillin import path needs zero Xano API work) — but that import path is slow (~5 min per 250-variant file) and the CSV can't carry review metadata. Decoupling the internal schema from both destinations means the SAME extraction feeds the CSV path (I2, ships immediately, no Xano work) and later the fast direct-creation path (I3, once the Xano bulk API is reworked) — no re-extraction, just a second destination adapter. The 5-min cost lives in Xano's import processing, not in our file analysis; I3 is the fix for it.
  - `profiles.py` — **boutique/supplier convention profiles**, data-driven (DB table + seed), one per (boutique, supplier):
    - pricing rule: e.g. L'Espion = round-up-to-nearest-5 of `wholesale × coefficient`; Garcia/Bambinoh = use `retailPrice` as-is
    - brand rule: fixed brand, or derived (Bambinoh: from supplier folder name, no uppercase)
    - category mapping: supplier label → Tillin category list; **leave empty when not deducible** (never guess)
    - season, VAT, and any boutique defaults
  - `csv_out.py` — render approved items to the **Tillin import CSV** format (the proven path used manually today).
- **`jobs/`** — reuse `queue.py`/`runner.py` with a job `type` (`enrichment` | `import`); new `import_item` staging table mirroring `enrichment_item`.
- **`destinations/`** — the existing port gains a `create_products` capability on the Tillin adapter (phase b); phase a ships with the CSV renderer only.
- **`api/`** — `POST /imports` (multipart upload), `GET /imports/{id}`, `PATCH /import_items/{id}`, approve/reject, `GET /imports/{id}/csv`, `GET/PUT /import_profiles`.

### Frontend (SvelteKit)
- `/imports/new` — file dropzone + boutique/supplier profile picker + option overrides (coefficient, season…).
- `/imports/[id]` — progress (same pattern as jobs).
- `/imports/[id]/review` — editable grid of extracted products (title, EAN, sizes/qty, computed retail price, category, brand) with per-field confidence highlighting; approve/reject; **Download Tillin CSV** / (later) **Create in Tillin**.
- `/settings/import-profiles` — manage convention profiles.

### Import sprint phasing
- **I1 — parse & extract — SHIPPED 2026-07-09:** upload → worker parses PDF/Excel/CSV → normalized products staged (with usage metering M1 wired in). Validated live: LTDC Excel → 19 products / 184 variants / 184 EANs cross-check-verified; L'Espion PDF (Paul Smith) → 36 products / 88 variants via Claude doc/vision. Real fixtures live in `everyday-tasks/` (user-provided, 2026-07-09):
  - `everyday-tasks/integration LEspion/pdfs traites/Confirmation12610566.pdf` (L'Espion order PDF)
  - `everyday-tasks/integration LEspion/pdfs traites/ORDER_PJLESPION--EURL-SAMANTA_2026-02-04_19026798.pdf` (L'Espion order PDF, larger)
  - `everyday-tasks/integration LEspion/pdfs traites/2026-06-30-19037114-Y-s.xlsx` (L'Espion Excel)
  - `everyday-tasks/integration Bambinoh/Le Temps Des Cerises/Commande BAMB3201 - 02359226.xlsx` (Bambinoh supplier Excel)
- **I2 — profiles & review — SHIPPED 2026-07-09:** convention profiles (data-driven per account/supplier: price retail-as-is or wholesale×coefficient rounded UP to `round_up_to`, barcode EAN or constructed REF-COLOR-SIZE, brand as-extracted/fixed, supplier/season labels, gender/category defaults, tax_rate, status), editable review grid (PATCH item payload validated against ImportedProduct + exclude/restore), Tillin import CSV rendered by ONE engine (`app/imports/tillin_csv.py`, 30 columns frozen against the real everyday-tasks files) feeding preview (`GET /rows`), download (`GET /csv`) and **direct transfer** (`POST /transfer` → Xano `POST /product_import`, multipart `file_import` + `location_id`; locations from `get_all_informations` minus third-party origins). Items become `applied` after transfer; CSV download kept as backup path. `import_profile` table = migration 0011.
  - **Transfer validated LIVE 2026-07-09**: Marc confirmed a real `POST /product_import` succeeded from the app (after fixing `list_locations` — `origin` is an object, filter on `origin.third_party`).
  - **I2.1 refinements (user feedback 2026-07-09) — SHIPPED:** import profiles moved from a Paramètres tab to their **own dedicated menu page** `/profiles` (30+ suppliers need search, not a settings tab) with a shared `ImportProfileForm` also usable inline from the import review page (create/edit without leaving, pre-filled with the detected supplier, auto-selected after save). Destination **location/magasin** now chosen at upload time (optional) and editable after extraction on the import detail page; the transfer panel pre-fills it. Classification fields (brand, category, season, composition, supplier) render as `ReferenceSelect` — same styled `<select>` as the existing product-search filters, current/extracted value injected if absent from the Tillin reference list, free text still possible — replacing the earlier native `<datalist>` inputs. `gender_default`/`category_default` removed from the profile config (per-product review-grid edits instead, not a supplier convention). The profile's computed sale price (coefficient mode) is now shown live in the review grid variants table, addressing user confusion ("le profil semblait sans effet" — it only applies at CSV/transfer render time, never rewrites extracted data).
- **I3 — direct creation — DEPRIORITIZED to the END of the plan (user decision 2026-07-09, after the CSV transfer path proved sufficient):** `create_products` on the Xano destination adapter (products + variants + EANs), duplicate detection against the existing Tillin catalog at **two levels** (semantics confirmed by Marc, 2026-07-09):
  - **EAN/barcode → variant-level check** (this exact variant already exists in Tillin)
  - **`product_reference_code` → product-level check** (the parent product already exists)
  - Either match → flag, don't recreate; surface the conflicting Tillin product/variant in review.
  - **Edge case — new color on an existing reference:** same `product_reference_code`, new color → the product exists but the incoming variants are new. When importing that into Tillin, the write must ADD the new color's variants and must NOT delete/replace the product's other colors. The safe write path is primarily a **Xano-side concern** (how the creation/update endpoint merges variants), but CatalogAI should detect the case and show an explicit indication in the review grid ("référence existante — ajout de coloris"). ⚠️ **REMIND MARC of this edge case when I3 starts** — he wants to weigh in on the Xano-side handling.
  - ⚠️ **CHECKPOINT before building I3 (user-requested, 2026-07-09):** the current Xano product-creation endpoint is NOT sized for volume writes. Stop and have Marc validate/rework the Xano API (bulk shape, rate, transactionality) before implementing the adapter — do not build against the existing endpoint as-is.

### Parallel agent workstreams
The sprint splits into lots with **disjoint write sets**, per the repo's delegation rules (one worker = one boundary; generated client + OpenAPI regen decided centrally in the main thread):

| Lot | Scope (write boundary) | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| A — parsing/extraction | `backend/app/imports/parsers/`, `extract.py` + tests/fixtures | nothing (contract: normalized schema, frozen first) |
| B — profiles & CSV out | `backend/app/imports/profiles.py`, `csv_out.py`, seed + tests | schema contract only |
| C — jobs/API plumbing | `backend/app/api/` (import routes/schemas/services), `jobs/` job-type, `models/` + Alembic migration | schema contract only |
| D — frontend | `frontend/src/routes/imports/**`, settings page | C's OpenAPI contract (mock until regen) |
| E — Xano direct creation (I3) | `backend/app/destinations/` + Xano-side thin endpoints | A–C shipped |

Sequencing: freeze the normalized product schema + API contract in the main thread first, then A, B, C run fully in parallel; D starts against the contract; E last. OpenAPI/client regeneration happens once in the main thread after C settles.

### Verification (import sprint)
1. **Unit:** parser fixtures (the real `everyday-tasks/` files listed in I1: 2 L'Espion PDFs, 1 L'Espion Excel, 1 Bambinoh/Le Temps Des Cerises Excel, plus 1 generic CSV) → expected normalized rows; pricing rule (`wholesale × coef` rounded up to nearest 5); category mapping leaves unknowns empty; EAN/price values are byte-identical to the source cells.
2. **Integration:** upload a real supplier file → review grid → approve → generated CSV imports cleanly into Tillin (manual import path).
3. **I3:** direct creation on 2–3 test products → products/variants/EANs visible in Tillin; duplicate upload is flagged, not recreated.

## Usage metering & client billing sprint (user-requested 2026-07-09)

CatalogAI will be priced to Tillin's clients on consumption: AI tokens first, plus the other metered tools (Photoroom credits, Firecrawl, later Bright Data). This is a platform brick — every pipeline (enrichment, import, future imagery) must be metered at the source so billing never needs per-feature retrofits.

### Design
- **`usage_event` table** (app Postgres): `id, account_id, job_id?, item_id?, source (enrichment|import|…), provider (claude|photoroom|firecrawl|unlocker), model?, metric (input_tokens|output_tokens|cache_read_tokens|images|credits|requests), quantity, created_at`. One row per external call; append-only.
- **Record at the client-wrapper level**, not in pipelines: `ClaudeClient.generate_copy` reads `response.usage` (input/output/cache tokens) and emits events; the Photoroom/Firecrawl wrappers count credits/requests the same way. Pipelines stay metering-agnostic — any new feature using the wrappers is billed for free.
- **Pricing table** (config or DB): unit cost per (provider, model, metric) + per-account margin/coefficient → computed cost and billable amount are derived at query time, never stored on the event (repricing stays possible).
- **API**: `GET /usage/summary?period=` (per account: totals by provider/metric, computed cost), `GET /usage/by-job` (unit economics per job/product — replaces the plan's "cost sanity" logging item).
- **UI**: « Consommation » — dashboard tile (month-to-date) + dedicated page: per month, per provider, per job; export CSV for invoicing.

### Phasing
- **M1 — record — SHIPPED:** usage_event table + Claude token capture (enrichment copy calls + import extraction calls metered from day one).
- **M2 — read — SHIPPED:** `GET /usage/summary` (per-model, monthly), `/usage/by-job` (per-job, sorted by cost), `/usage/export` (invoice CSV), `/usage/timeseries?group_by=none|model|provider` (daily billable, 3 chart views — inline SVG, no chart lib). Page « Consommation » (sidebar, Configuration section): month picker, cost/billable/token summary cards, per-model + per-job tables, daily evolution charts, CSV export.
- **M3 — rate — SHIPPED:** `usage_price` table (unit price per provider/model/metric, model=null = provider-wide fallback), editable pricing grid (token prices entered per **million**, stored per unit) + `billing_coefficient` (billable = cost × coefficient) on `AccountSettings`.
  - **Monthly price freeze (user-requested 2026-07-09) — SHIPPED:** cost must NEVER move once a month is billed. `AccountSettings.billing_day` (1..28, default 1): a period is billed on `billing_day` of the FOLLOWING month (July billed Aug-05 if billing_day=5). Once today reaches that date the month is "frozen": on first read, an immutable `usage_billing_snapshot` (migration 0013) pins the current prices + coefficient; all reads of that month (summary/by-job/export/timeseries) use the frozen values from then on (consumption quantities stay in `usage_event`, immutable for a past month, so recomputed costs are stable). Current/future months keep using the live grid. Safety net: `POST /usage/snapshot` re-freezes from the current grid (`400 not_frozen` on a non-billed month). Setting lives in Paramètres > Compte ("Jour de facturation").

Multi-account note: today the app has a single "default" account; per-client billing becomes meaningful when client boutiques get their own accounts — the account_id dimension is in the schema from M1 so no backfill is needed.

## Sprint imagerie — Image Processing Service (specced 2026-07-10)

Consolidates every image-processing item scattered above (Locked decisions L15-16,
`images.py` module spec, Xano attach endpoint, open items) into one specced sprint.
Architecture direction brought by Marc and validated together; scoping decisions
(à-la-carte first, replacement endpoint) settled by AskUserQuestion 2026-07-10.

### Decisions (locked)

- **Internal API in business verbs, not provider capabilities** — providers are
  hidden behind interchangeable adapters (anti-corruption layer).
- **Two pipelines, two providers:**
  - **Deterministic** (process existing photos) → **Photoroom API**: cutout +
    solid background + shadow + resize/ratio 4:5. ~0.02 $/img.
  - **Generative** (product worn by a model, solid background) → **FASHN API**
    (`product-to-model`). Absolute priority = garment fidelity (prints, textures,
    seams, colors, proportions). ~0.04 $/img at volume. Supersedes the earlier
    "Photoroom Virtual Model API" idea from the old future-sprints note.
- **Local code (Pillow/CV) is a provider like any other** (crop, padding, ratios,
  geometric harmonization, manual recenter).
- **Queue = the existing job system** (`enrichment_job`/`enrichment_item`,
  Postgres SKIP LOCKED queue in `jobs/queue.py`, FastAPI BackgroundTask runner) —
  **no new broker** (Celery/Redis/…). Tens of thousands of images/month ≈
  ~1,500/working day: the existing polling worker absorbs it.
- **"Service" = a module** (`backend/app/imaging/`), NOT a microservice. The
  "stable internal API" is the Python signatures of the verbs. The ACL makes a
  later extraction trivial if scaling ever demands it.
- **Traceability on every generated asset:** provider + model version + seed
  (reproducibility + audit when switching providers).
- **Storage: no third-party object storage.** Final = Xano via
  `POST /product_image/{id}/bulk` (files branch, already wired through
  `XanoClient.upload_product_images`, validated end-to-end). Replacement = new
  `PUT /product_image/deactivate` (`product_image_ids: int[]`, created by Marc)
  since the bulk only APPENDS. Staging = ephemeral local disk.
- **Metering mandatory at the wrapper level** — every Photoroom/FASHN call emits
  `usage_event` rows (same pattern as `record_claude_usage`); pipelines stay
  metering-agnostic. No `usage_event` schema change needed (provider/metric are
  free strings by design).
- **Do NOT over-engineer:** one interface + one implementation per verb. No
  multi-provider routing engine while there is a single provider per verb (the
  `local` provider is not routing — it covers operations the APIs don't do).

### 1. Architecture — `backend/app/imaging/`

`service.py` exposes the verbs; providers live behind them.

- `normalize_product_image(src, *, bg_color, ratio="4:5", output_size="1600x2000",
  padding="10%", fmt="webp", quality=80, max_kb=200, center_offset=None)
  -> ImagingResult` — deterministic: cutout + solid bg + shadow + pad to 4:5 +
  format/weight. Background change is a **parameter** of this verb, not a verb.
  Provider: Photoroom. Manual recenter / `off_center` QA flag = **local** provider
  (Pillow composites the RGBA cutout at `center_offset`; `getbbox()` vs frame
  center for the QA badge — reuses the historical `images.py` spec above).
- `generate_model_photo(product_image, *, prompt=None, aspect_ratio="4:5",
  resolution="1k", generation_mode="balanced", seed=42, num_images=1)
  -> list[ImagingResult]` — generative, provider FASHN `product-to-model`.
- `generate_flat_photo()` (worn → flat) — **deferred**: no confirmed FASHN
  endpoint; reserved in the interface, not implemented.
- `ImagingResult = {staged_path, width, height, format, trace}` with
  `trace = {provider, model, model_version?, seed?, params}` — systematic.

### 2. Adapters (`backend/app/clients/`)

- `photoroom.py` **exists** (`edit_image`, POST `/v2/edit`, orphan today): adapt —
  drive params from the verb options, optionally return the RGBA cutout, expose
  cost in the result (1 image = 1 unit). ⚠ v2 param names to confirm with a
  **live call** at build time (repo golden rule).
- `fashn.py` **new**, on the `base.py` pattern (`NotConfiguredError` /
  `ExternalServiceError`, `from_settings`, httpx.Client):
  `run(model_name, inputs) -> prediction_id` (POST `/v1/run`),
  `wait(prediction_id, timeout=120)` (poll GET `/v1/status/{id}` until
  `completed`, `output: [CDN urls]`), then **download immediately to staging**
  (CDN expiry unknown — never store the bare URL). Generation takes 10–55 s.
  Add setting **`FASHN_API_KEY`** to `core/config.py` + `.env.example`.
- **Metering:** clients expose cost in their result; the imaging service emits
  via `record_usage(...)` (`backend/app/api/services/usage.py`) — provider
  `photoroom` metric `images`, provider `fashn` metric `credits` (1k=1-3,
  2k=2-4, 4k=3-5 credits per image by generation_mode; ×num_images;
  face_reference +3).

### 3. Persistence & storage

- **New table `image_asset`** (one table, three jobs: async task tracking for
  à-la-carte actions, provenance trace, audit):
  `id, account_id, product_id, verb, provider, model, seed, params_json,
  status (pending|processing|completed|failed), source_image,
  staged_paths_json, tillin_image_ids_json, error, created_at, finished_at`.
- **Staging:** `backend/var/imaging/` (sibling of `UPLOAD_DIR`), served by an
  authenticated backend route for previews; purged after save or via simple TTL.
- **Final:** `XanoClient.upload_product_images(product_id, files)` (bulk files
  branch); **replacement** = upload then `PUT /product_image/deactivate
  {product_image_ids}` on the originals (new `XanoClient.deactivate_product_images(ids)`;
  the bulk response contains the created ids).

### 4. Phase A — à la carte (product panel) — FIRST

- Routes:
  - `POST /products/{id}/images/normalize` — sync (Photoroom answers in seconds);
    body: image sources + options + `replace: bool`.
  - `POST /products/{id}/images/generate-model` → **202 + `image_asset.id`**
    (FASHN 10–55 s: FastAPI BackgroundTask polls FASHN, writes result to staging).
  - `GET /imaging/assets/{id}` — status + preview.
  - `POST /imaging/assets/{id}/save` — push to Xano bulk + optional deactivate.
- Frontend: activate the disabled "Images (Photoroom)" section of
  `ProductPanel.svelte` → per image: « Normaliser (détourage + fond 4:5) »,
  « Générer porté mannequin »; before/after preview in the panel; « Enregistrer »
  = save (+ « remplacer l'originale » checkbox for normalize). Light polling in
  the panel for the generative action.

### 5. Phase B — batch (enrichment pipeline) — SHIPPED 2026-07-10

Both phases are SHIPPED (A: à-la-carte panel actions + live-validated verbs;
B: batch normalize + `config_json.transforms` toggles {copy,title,weights,
images} — absent key = enabled — honoured by the pipeline and exposed in the
product panel's "Enrichir" chooser and JobOptionsPanel; review shows
before/after with authenticated previews). Live-validated end to end on the
test product (manual restage → 6 normalized → selective apply → deactivate,
net zero). Known gap: auto source resolution broke on salomon.com redirects —
scraping robustness stays in the infra sprint (Firecrawl fallback).

- Replaces the Photoroom TODO in `enrich/pipeline.py`: resolved source images go
  through `normalize_product_image`; results staged in `staged_images_json`
  (entries enriched with the `trace`); before/after review; apply via bulk
  **files** (no longer `add_product_images` by URLs).
- `config_json`: block `image {bg_color, ratio:"4:5", output_size:"1600x2000",
  padding:"10%", format:"webp"→fallback jpeg, quality:80, max_kb:200}` +
  `filename_template` (`{reference}_{color}_{position}`) — exposed in
  `JobOptionsPanel.svelte`.
- The generative verb is **NOT** in the batch in Phase B (à la carte only) —
  cost + mandatory visual validation.
- **Reworked 2026-07-10 (user decision):** the batch stages the ORIGINAL
  source images; normalization is chosen **per image in the review**
  (POST /items/{id}/images/normalize, revert supported, reviewer selection
  follows the entry). `config_json.image.auto_normalize: true` keeps the old
  normalize-everything behavior as an opt-in. Same day fixes: Xano bulk
  multipart must use **`files[]`** (plain `files` silently keeps only the
  first file — root cause of "applied images never reached Tillin"),
  `{color}` title token reads the variants' Tillin options (+ dangling
  separator cleanup), manual resolve accepts any http(s) URL (the schema
  still required `/products/`), and the product-panel "Enrichir" chooser
  gained transform checkboxes + an instruction picker (instructions were
  silently skipped when enriching from the panel).

### Deferred / open items

- `generate_flat_photo` (worn → flat) — wait for a suitable FASHN endpoint.
- Per-category fill ratio (already noted in the historical `images.py` spec).
- Multi-provider routing — when a second provider exists for a verb.
- ~~Confirm Photoroom v2 params~~ — **CONFIRMED live 2026-07-10**: `/v2/edit`
  takes the params as **GET query params** (`imageUrl`, `background.color`,
  `outputSize`, `padding`, `export.format`, `export.quality`); JSON POST is
  rejected (400 — POST is multipart-only, the future bytes-input path). Still
  open: RGBA cutout retrieval for the Pillow manual-recenter path.
- ~~FASHN consumed credits in /status?~~ — static grid in use
  (`fashn_credits()`), validated live 2026-07-10 (`product-to-model` run/status
  flow works as documented; without a prompt FASHN picks a free outdoor scene,
  hence the default prompt "studio photo, plain light neutral background" to
  honour the plain-background decision).
- ~~Drop the `.xs` export of `PUT /product_image/deactivate`~~ — **DONE
  2026-07-10** (`fichiers_xano/endpoints_xano/6546_product_image_deactivate.xs`);
  endpoint validated live (upload + deactivate, net zero).

  ombre » = génération FASHN (voir items 2-3 ci-dessous, non livrés).

### Spécifications d'origine (2026-07-12)

Chantiers liés au traitement/génération d'image :

1. **Normalisation produit configurable** : trouver une solution pérenne pour
   le traitement d'image produit — mise au format **4:5**, **fond uni dont la
   couleur (code hex) est configurable dans les paramètres du client**
   (nouveau champ `AccountSettings`, ex. `imaging_background_color`, exposé
   dans les réglages), et **centrage du produit**. État des lieux : Photoroom
   `/v2/edit` fait déjà détourage + fond + 4:5 + padding 10 %, mais la couleur
   est en dur (`FFFFFF` dans `PhotoroomClient.edit_image`) et l'API d'édition
   coûte 0,10 $/image en prod (clé actuelle = sandbox avec filigrane).
   **Process retenu (décision 2026-07-12)** : Photoroom **Remove Background à
   0,02 $/image** (cutout RGBA) + **Pillow maison** pour le reste — canevas
   4:5 (1600×2000) rempli avec le hex du client, centrage du produit via la
   boîte englobante, export WebP/JPEG. **L'ombre n'est PAS prise en compte**
   dans cette normalisation (elle imposerait l'API d'édition à 0,10 $ via
   `shadow.mode` — écarté pour l'instant). Prérequis technique : confirmer la
   récupération du cutout transparent (item RGBA déjà ouvert au sprint
   imagerie). Comparatif détourage seul (2026-07-12) : Photoroom remove-bg
   0,02 $ < FASHN background-remove (1 crédit = 0,075 $ à la demande,
   ~0,049 $ au palier max) < remove.bg (~0,20 $) — Photoroom confirmé.
   *Idée à creuser, hors périmètre de la normalisation* : le « produit à
   plat avec ombre » pensé comme une **génération d'image** côté FASHN
   (comme le porté-mannequin), à rapprocher de l'item en attente
   `generate_flat_photo` — les endpoints FASHN actuels font du porté, pas du
   flat-lay ; à réévaluer quand un endpoint adapté existe.

1bis. **Traitements à la carte** (demandé 2026-07-12) : l'utilisateur choisit
   les opérations de SA normalisation au lieu d'un pipeline figé —
   **détourage** on/off, **fond uni** (hex), **ratio** (4:5 par défaut,
   autres formats : 1:1, 3:4, 16:9, original), **format d'export**
   (WebP/JPEG/PNG), **centrage** on/off, **compression** (qualité / poids
   cible). Le pipeline Pillow retenu rend chaque étape débrayable
   naturellement (c'est notre code) ; seul le détourage appelle Photoroom.
   Défauts par client dans les réglages (`AccountSettings.imaging_*`),
   ajustables au lancement d'un traitement ; options persistées dans
   `ImageAsset.params_json` (existe déjà).

1ter. **Poids, noms et modèle de titre d'image** (demandé 2026-07-12) :
   - **Poids affiché** : taille (Ko) des images produites ET des sources —
     stocker les octets dans les métadonnées de staging (aujourd'hui
     `staged_paths_json` ne garde que les chemins) et les exposer dans
     l'API ; le poids cible de compression devient vérifiable d'un coup
     d'œil.
   - **Renommage** : nom de fichier éditable image par image avant
     l'enregistrement vers Tillin.
   - **Modèle de titre d'image** : même mécanique que le modèle de titre
     produit (builder + variables + casse), appliqué à toutes les images
     d'un produit — variables proposées de longue date `{reference}`,
     `{color}`, `{position}` (cf. Open items). Config dans les réglages
     d'enrichissement, à côté du modèle de titre produit.

1quater. **Repositionnement manuel du produit** (question 2026-07-12 —
   réponse : OUI, coût raisonnable AVEC le pipeline Pillow) : comme on
   compose nous-mêmes le cutout RGBA sur le canevas, il suffit d'exposer
   offset x/y + échelle — le front affiche l'aperçu avec le produit
   déplaçable/zoomable (drag + slider), le back recompose depuis le cutout
   conservé en staging (aucun nouvel appel Photoroom : re-render Pillow
   instantané et gratuit). Infaisable proprement avec l'appel unique
   `/v2/edit` — argument supplémentaire pour le process retenu. Conserver le
   cutout RGBA en staging tant que l'asset n'est pas enregistré.

1quinquies. **Interface — sortir du panneau latéral** (question 2026-07-12) :
   le panneau produit reste pour les actions rapides (normaliser avec les
   défauts, générer un porté), mais options à la carte + avant/après +
   poids + renommage + repositionnement ne tiennent pas dans ~400 px.
   Décision : **espace de travail image dédié** (page
   `/products/{id}/images` ou modale plein écran ouverte depuis le
   panneau) — grille des images avec poids et statut, sélection multiple,
   colonne d'options de traitement, aperçu avant/après grand format,
   éditeur de position, renommage inline + application du modèle de titre,
   enregistrement vers Tillin en lot.
2. **Instruction de génération FASHN** : CONFIRMÉ (docs 2026-07-12) —
   `product-to-model` accepte un `prompt` texte (ex. "professional office
   setting") ainsi que `image_prompt` (image d'inspiration pose/décor),
   `background_reference` (ancre le décor), `face_reference` (identité du
   mannequin), `num_outputs` (1-4) et `seed`. Aujourd'hui le prompt est en dur
   dans `GenerateModelOptions` ("studio photo, plain light neutral
   background") : il faut pouvoir passer une instruction à FASHN depuis
   l'app.
3. **Config d'instruction globale de génération** (dépend du 2) : réglage
   par client (dans les paramètres / réglages d'enrichissement) décrivant le
   rendu attendu des visuels générés — mannequin entier ou cadrage tête
   coupée, photo studio ou mise en scène (lifestyle), et autres directives
   libres — traduit en `prompt` FASHN à chaque génération. Prévoir le défaut
   actuel (studio, fond neutre) comme valeur initiale, et l'articulation avec
   le futur verbe « in-scene / lifestyle » (section Future ci-dessous).

## Future / separate sprints (out of scope here)
- **In-scene / lifestyle imagery:** generative scene from a text prompt (e.g.
  Photoroom **AI Backgrounds** or a FASHN background endpoint) — a possible later
  verb on top of the imagery sprint's service; on-model generation itself is now
  covered by the imagery sprint (FASHN, which superseded the old "Photoroom
  Virtual Model API" idea).
- **Per-category consistent sizing:** the per-category fill-ratio enhancement above, if pursued.

## Verification
1. **Unit (pytest):** suggest.json matcher returns the right handle for `G5FU-T081` on `https://gramicci.co.uk`; `apply_title_template`; weight conversion; `process_image` returns a **4:5** JPEG at target size on the configured bg color; `generate_copy` returns FR description+meta for **both** Claude and OpenAI.
2. **Integration:** run a job over 2–3 tagged test products → worker stages results → review queue shows before/after → approve one → confirm the Tillin product/variants/images updated and the existing Shopify sync reflects it.
3. **Scraping:** Firecrawl fetch on a non-Shopify page; per-product method override works; (Phase 3) unlocker succeeds on an Asics/Farfetch page.
4. **Cost sanity:** per-product spend (Firecrawl + Photoroom + Claude) — superseded by the usage metering sprint's `GET /usage/by-job` (see the dedicated section); validate unit economics before scaling batch size.

## Open items to confirm during build
- Exact template strings (proposed title `{Brand} {Title}`, filename `{reference}_{color}_{position}`).
- Resize pixels for 4:5 (proposed 1600×2000), default `padding` (proposed ~10%), and `off_center` flag threshold; Photoroom param confirmation + cutout/RGBA → moved to the imagery sprint's open items (see that section).
- Default AI model per provider (proposed `claude-sonnet-4-6`; `claude-opus-4-8` when quality matters).
- Output format (proposed WebP master, JPEG fallback) + target/cap weight (proposed q≈80, ≤200 KB at 1600×2000).
- ~~Object storage choice for processed images~~ — **RESOLVED 2026-07-10**: no third-party storage; Xano is the durable store (bulk files branch), local disk (`backend/var/imaging/`) is the ephemeral staging. See the imagery sprint section.
- How `brand.website_url` gets populated for the existing brand catalog (bulk set vs per-brand UI).
- Legal/ToS note for marketplace sources (Farfetch) vs brands' own sites.
